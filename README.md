# FIFO-Project-in-Verilog
A FIFO (First-In-First-Out) project in Verilog is used to temporarily store data so that the first written data is the first to be read. It typically has write pointer, read pointer, memory array, full and empty flags to manage data flow. FIFO is widely used in data buffering, clock domain crossing, and communication systems.
